I'm Joaquín Sorianello, an Argentinian software developer.

On June 25, 2015, ten days before the first elections using e-voting in Buenos Aires city, I informed the company **Magic Software Argentina (MSA)** about some security problems with their servers that put the election process at risk.

The night of Friday July 3rd, two days before the elections, "cybercrime" personnel from the Metropolitan Police came to my house and made forceful entry with an order from judge **Luisa María Escrich**, and they took my computers and equipment I use to work every day.

Since then I've been charged with **Informatic Damage** and I have to find the money to pay lawyers and legal costs.

For this reason I need the help of all of you.
