I'm Joaquín Sorianello, an argentinian software developer.
On June 25, 2015, ten days before the first elections using e-vote in
Buenos Aires city, I reported to the company Magic Software Argentina
(MSA) some security problems in your servers that put in risk the
election process.
The friday night of July 3, two days before the elections, "cybercrime" personal from
Metropolitan Police came to my house to
forceful entry with an order by the judge Luisa María Escrich and they
took my computers and equipment I use to work everyday.
Since that I'm processed by "Informatic Damage" and I have to face
the money to pay lawers and proficients.
For this reason I need the collaboration of all of you.
